Objective
</td>
<td id="objective">
<p>This test case is intended to verify the following implied or specified requirements:</p>

<ul id="requirementsList">

<li>When the app is started by selecting from the Android app selection menu, the app shall do the following:</li>
<li>If the portfolio database does exist, the app shall query the public server to retrieve and store the latest closing price for each stock ticker in the portfolio and then display a blanked main menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>The objective of this test case is to verify the above requirements.  This test will be executed following the first time the app is loaded onto the Android device.  At that point, a portfolio will not exist so no database creation will be necessary.</p>

Expected
</td>
<td id="expected">
This being the second time the app has run on the device, the database should be there but empty.  Pressing the next button the first time shows that.  Pressing the next button after an entry is inserted then displays a stock entry, but since the ticker is not a valid stock ticker, no value for the stock can be displayed.</td>
