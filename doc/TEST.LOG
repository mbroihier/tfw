Pressed Next and observed a ticker of AAA and number of shares 1.  The value for the shares was displayed as 0.  This
was not expected, but this was not the objective of this case - only that the portfolio value was stored and used for
retrieval (which would fail this time because AAA does not exist).

Log data:
Started from the end of test case ENTER-010.
After entering the symbol AAA and pressing next three times I saw 0, not "Not found".  Although this was not the 
expected answer, it did illustrate that 0 was the value of the stock stored for AAA, an invalid ticker.
A subsequent next press presented a blank screen.

Test Start Time: 12/31/2016 16:21 CST
Log data:
Deleted app from MotoG and recompiled/installed.
Entered sequence in the procedure and verified that delete itself functioned as intended in 
terms of deleting when a ticker was displayed, and doing nothing otherwise.
However, I noted that the calculated net value field retained the value from the AAPL and INTC
tickers.  This doesn't seem quiet right.  Seems the net value should be adjusted after a ticker
is eliminated.

Deleted app from MotoG and recompiled/installed.
Entered 
AAPL, 200 shares, 
FBIOX, 235.498, 
SPY, 200, 
CSCS, 200, 
FSLR, 100, 
INTC, 500,

TM, 200, 
TXN, 964, 
VIGRX, 1269.985, 
BAC, 600, 
SIRI, 10000
When I got to this point, I found that BAC was failing to obtain a price.  This was because the parse looking for
the closing price was looking for digits dot digits and the price was an even 22 dollars with no tailing cents.
Additionally I found that the lookup was not being repeated when the calculate net value was pushed because the
indicator was indicating that the last looked up was still in progress.

Test Start Time: 01/09/2017 17:24 CST
Log data:
Instead of starting from scratch, I started the latest version on my MotoG.  This version has a fix for the parse error identified by test case PERF-010 and fixes to the reset of the rety object that was falsely saying that a lookup was still in progress if some sort of abnormal event occurred during the lookup.
After the app restart, I verified that there was a ticker symbol field, a number of shares field, and a value for each share field.  I verified that there was an enter, delete, and next button on one line and a calculate net value button at the bottom of the display.
No runtime errors occurred.
I selected the stock ticker symbol and verified that I got a keyboard that allowed me to put A-Z and 0-9 in as characters.  I entered all characters the keyboard gave me into the ticker symbol along with a number of shares of 1 and entered the value.  The app let me do it and I then deleted the entry.  That worked, too.
